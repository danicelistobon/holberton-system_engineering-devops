# 0x1B. Web stack debugging #4

| 0-the_sky_is_the_limit_not.pp | For the benchmarking, we are using ApacheBench which is a quite popular tool in the industry. It allows you to simulate HTTP requests to a web server. In this case, I will make 2000 requests to my server with 100 requests at a time. We can see that 943 requests failed, lets fix our stack so that we get to 0, and remember that when something is going wrong, logs are your best friends! |
